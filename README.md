# miles tones - the 'pitch pipe'

![](/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/pipe_01.png)

This was a project for a class on Object Oriented design. It's basically a little mini-synthesizer a single oscillator and envelope.  

I figured I would put it up for free in the Google play store. Why not? The sound is a bit raw, but it does work. And after all, the price is right. But with the many things being juggled I've been a bit remiss on maintenance. 

However, it is back on the radar, as I have been working on [the OndeSynth](https://github.com/mlzarathustra/ondes), which started out loosely based on the current project. However, it's now much more capable that the original "tones" app, and the JAR is about a half a meg, so my plan is to include the Ondes tone generator in the "pitch pipe."  That should result in some better sounds. One might hope!

(actually, a single oscillator plus an LFO for PWM)
 - LFO = Low Frequency Oscillator
 - PWM = Pulse Width Modulation
